## ✅ Step 1: Understand the Daily Lab Limit

Before you begin, it's very important to understand the **Daily Lab Limit** system.

This guide explains:
- How many labs you can attempt daily
- When the limits reset

⚠️ **Pro Tip:** Avoid retrying failed labs too many times. They still count against your daily limit!
